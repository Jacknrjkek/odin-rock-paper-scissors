Rock Paper Scissors - A Console-Based Game

Introduction

The goal of this project is to create a simple implementation of the grade-school classic game "Rock, Paper, Scissors". As one of the fundamental exercises for learning JavaScript, this project is designed to solidify understanding of basic programming concepts such as functions, conditionals, and basic user interaction via the browser console. We begin by creating a game that can be played completely from the console, but there is potential to revisit and enhance it with a graphical user interface in the future.

Why this project?

Grasp Fundamentals: Building a game like "Rock, Paper, Scissors" helps in understanding the fundamental concepts of programming. Itâ€™s a simple game, yet it incorporates several basic principles of game mechanics that are applicable in more complex games.
User Interaction: Using the browser console is a rudimentary way of getting input from a user and displaying an output. It's an introduction to the concept of user interactivity.
Functionality over Aesthetics: While there are no fancy graphics, focusing on the console allows for a concentration on logic and functionality, which is the core of any application.
Scalability: This project can be a starting point. Once the logic is correctly implemented, it can be expanded with a graphical interface, multi-player options, or even more complex game mechanics.
Key Features

Random Computer Choice: The computer's choice is randomized to mimic a real opponent and ensure unpredictability.
Case-Insensitive User Input: The game is user-friendly. Regardless of how the user types their choice (e.g., "rock", "ROCK", "RoCk"), the game will understand and process the input.
Scoring System: The game is not just about a single round; it's about winning the match. The first to win 3 rounds is declared the overall winner.
User Guidance: Through prompts and console outputs, the user is constantly informed about the game's progress, scores, and results.
How to Play

Start the game.
When prompted, type in your choice: Rock, Paper, or Scissors.
The computer will make its choice, and the round's winner will be declared in the console.
Play until either you or the computer score 3 points.
The overall winner will be declared!
Future Improvements

Graphical User Interface: A user-friendly interface with buttons for choices and display for scores.
Additional Game Mechanics: Introduce "Lizard" and "Spock" to make the game more interesting.
Multiplayer: Allow two users to play against each other.
Conclusion

This project serves as a foundation in the journey of learning JavaScript and programming as a whole. The concepts learned and implemented here will be invaluable in future, more complex projects.
